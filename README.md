### Business Overview/Problem
 
 GreenTech Innovation, despite its impressive 15-year history and leadership in the renewable energy sector, faces several critical human resources challenges that need to be addressed through data-driven HR analytics. These challenges include the need to enhance employee performance, engagement, and growth. 

✓ Employee Performance: GreenTech Innovation lacks a comprehensive system to assess and track individual and team performance effectively. The absence of a clear performance evaluation process makes it difficult to identify and reward high-performing employees. This issue poses a significant challenge as recognizing and incentivizing top talent is essential for sustaining the company's competitive edge in a dynamic market.
 
✓ Employee Engagement: Employee engagement is a critical factor influencing productivity, job satisfaction, and retention rates. GreenTech Innovation requires a way to measure and understand employee engagement levels accurately. Without a robust system for collecting and analyzing data related to engagement, it becomes challenging to address issues that may lead to decreased morale and attrition within the workforce.
 

Addressing these HR challenges is crucial not only for maintaining a motivated and skilled workforce but also for sustaining the company's position as a leader in the GreenTech sector.

## Rationale for the Project

HR Analytics, also known as Human Resources Analytics or People Analytics, is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting GreenTech Innovation data to make informed data-driven decisions. It gives insights into various aspects of HR management, such as employee performance, recruitment, retention, engagement, and talent development. HR Analytics optimizes HR strategies and practices to better align with the GreenTech Innovation overall goals and objectives.

Human Resources (HR) Analytics is indispensable for GreenTech Innovation for several compelling reasons. Itprovides the means to transform HR from a traditionally administrative function into a strategic partner in driving organizational success. By harnessing the power of data and analytics, HR can make informed decisions that directly impact business outcomes. For instance, HR Analytics can identify patterns in employee turnover and engagement, allowing organizations to proactively address retention issues and optimize workforce planning. 

In today's highly competitive talent market, attracting and retaining top talent is a critical business imperative. HR Analytics enables GreenTech Innovation to not only understand their workforce better but also predict future trends. This empowers them to create more appealing workplace environments, tailor benefits packages to employee needs, and develop targeted talent acquisition strategies. By aligning HR practices with data-driven insights, the company can optimize recruitment efforts, nurture talent, and ensure they have the right people with the right skills to meet evolving business demands.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

•	Consider providing additional support or opportunities for employees with lower educational qualifications to improve their engagement and performance, as they currently have lower scores compared to those with higher qualifications.

•	Recognize the positive impact of diverse employees on engagement and performance. Consider promoting a supportive work environment for all marital status categories, as it may contribute to improved engagement and performance across the board.

•	Evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment sources with a focus on enhancing engagement. Consider investing more in sources that have demonstrated higher engagement scores, such as On-Iine Web applications. Leverage the strong performance of older employees (49- above 66 age range) by providing mentorship programs or knowledge-sharing opportunities that allow them to 49- above their experience and knowledge to the organization.

•	Recognize the high performance of employees with 7 and 10 years of service. Retention strategies or career development opportunities can be expanded to retain and further enhance the performance of these employees. Learn from the Admin Offices department, which has the highest performance scores. Share best practices across departments to improve overall performance levels.
